Build Something of Your Choice!

My goal was to start learning basic layout and styling by replicating the header of my company's website.

I wanted to have practice with hyperlinks, images, and block arranging.

Ideally, the navigation menu would also have drop-down menus for further display, but I did not have time to incorporate these.
